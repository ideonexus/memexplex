Installation Notes:

----- QuickStart ------

The easiest thing to do is to run mxplx using the server2go bundle, which should *just work* out of the box, but to configure mxplx for other environments, see below.

If Running off the 4MB database with 2500 memes:
Login: idea@mxplx.com
Password: password

----- Customized Start -----

/application/memexplex/classes/persistence/MySqlConfig.php
Configures access to the MySQL database. Replace each of the following lines with your own DB access configuration:
//database server
define('DB_SERVER', "localhost");
//database login name
define('DB_USER', "DBUSER_HERE");
//database login password
define('DB_PASS', "DBPASSWORD_HERE");
//database name
define('DB_DATABASE', "memexplex_db");

/framework/config/environments.xml
Defines the environments mxplx will run in. The "localhost:4001" is for running locally, the production is what I use to run the site on mxplx.com. You can define more than one address in an environment. If you want to run mxplx locally on a different localhost address, change the local values. If you want to run mxplx on a web host with a domain name, modify the production enironment addresses.
